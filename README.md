## Running Live Demo segments of Deck

* you need to clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/paulczar/devops-austin-docker.git`
* All demos are in the `live_demo` directory
* Assume you're on a Linux box with Docker 6.x installed
** ^ Should be able to run inside vagrant if not linux.
* If demo goes haywire './clean.sh' will nuke all running containers.
